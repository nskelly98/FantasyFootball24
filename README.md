# Fantasy Football Performance Prediction Model

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a predictive model for fantasy football performance, leveraging a variety of data sources, including historical player statistics, rookie data, coaching strategies, and team schedules. The model will be built through a comprehensive process of data collection, wrangling, model creation, testing, and deployment, with the goal of providing accurate and actionable insights for fantasy football enthusiasts.

## 1. Data Collection

### 1.1. Historical Player Data
- **Source**: Pro Football Reference, Football Outsiders, ESPN, Yahoo Fantasy
- **Details**: Includes player statistics such as yards, touchdowns, interceptions, game logs, injuries, and player usage.
- **Time Frame**: At least 5 years of data.

### 1.2. Rookie Data
- **Source**: NFL Draft data, college statistics (ESPN, NCAA), Combine results.
- **Details**: College performance metrics, Combine results (speed, agility), scouting reports.

### 1.3. Coach Data
- **Source**: NFL official site, team websites, coaching analysis websites.
- **Details**: Coaching history, offensive and defensive schemes, coaching style, historical performance with teams.

### 1.4. Team Schedule and Game Data
- **Source**: NFL official site, sports data providers.
- **Details**: Team schedules, game locations, opponent strength, weather conditions.

### 1.5. Other Relevant Data
- **Source**: Fantasy football expert rankings, player news, team depth charts.
- **Details**: Expert projections, news affecting player performance (trades, injuries).

## 2. Data Wrangling

### 2.1. Data Cleaning
- **Remove Duplicates**: Ensure there are no duplicate records.
- **Handle Missing Values**: Impute or use methods to handle missing values in the dataset.
- **Normalize Data**: Standardize metrics for comparability (e.g., yards, touchdowns).

### 2.2. Feature Engineering
- **Player Metrics**: Create features based on player performance (e.g., yards per game, touchdown ratios).
- **Rookie Features**: Develop features based on college performance, Combine results, and pre-draft evaluations.
- **Coach Metrics**: Create features related to coaching strategies and historical performance with teams.
- **Schedule Impact**: Include features that capture the impact of team schedules and game conditions (e.g., opponent strength, weather).

### 2.3. Data Integration
- **Merge Datasets**: Combine player stats, rookie data, coach information, and schedules into a unified dataset.
- **Temporal Alignment**: Ensure that all data points are aligned temporally to avoid mismatches.

## 3. Model Creation

### 3.1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Analyze distributions, correlations, and patterns in the data.
- **Visualization**: Use plots to visualize relationships between variables and performance metrics.

### 3.2. Model Selection
- **Baseline Models**: Start with simpler models like linear regression or logistic regression to set a performance baseline.
- **Advanced Models**: Consider more complex models like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs), Random Forests, and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).

### 3.3. Feature Selection
- **Importance Analysis**: Use feature importance techniques (e.g., SHAP values) to select relevant features.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) if needed.

### 3.4. Model Training
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize model parameters using techniques such as grid search or Bayesian optimization.
- **Cross-Validation**: Use temporal cross-validation to evaluate model performance while respecting the time series nature of the data.

## 4. Model Testing

### 4.1. Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Measure model accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or F1 Score.
- **Precision and Recall**: For classification tasks, evaluate precision, recall, and the F1 score.
- **Backtesting**: Test the model on historical data to assess its performance in past seasons.

### 4.2. Model Validation
- **Validation Set**: Evaluate model performance on a separate validation dataset that was not used during training.
- **Scenario Testing**: Test how the model performs under different scenarios (e.g., player injuries, coaching changes).

## 5. Implementation

### 5.1. Deployment
- **Integration**: Integrate the model into a platform or application where it can be used for real-time predictions (e.g., a web application or API).
- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface to display predictions and rankings.

### 5.2. Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Performance Tracking**: Continuously monitor model performance and update as needed.
- **Data Updates**: Regularly update the dataset with new player data, rookie information, and game results.

### 5.3. Documentation
- **Technical Documentation**: Provide documentation for the modelâ€™s design, data sources, and implementation details.
- **User Guides**: Create guides or tutorials for users on how to interpret and use the predictions.

### 5.4. Feedback Loop
- **Collect Feedback**: Gather feedback from users and stakeholders to improve the model.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Refine and update the model based on feedback and new data.
